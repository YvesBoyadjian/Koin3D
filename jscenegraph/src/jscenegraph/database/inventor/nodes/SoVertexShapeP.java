  \class SoVertexShape SoVertexShape.h Inventor/nodes/SoVertexShape.h
  \brief The SoVertexShape class is the superclass for all vertex based shapes.
  \ingroup nodes

  Basically, every polygon-, line- or point-based shape will inherit
  this class.  It contains methods for organizing the normal cache,
  and also holds the SoVertexShape::vertexProperty field which can be
  used to set vertex data inside the node.
*/


// *************************************************************************

/*!
  \var SoSFNode SoVertexShape::vertexProperty

  If you set the vertexProperty field, it should be with an
  SoVertexProperty node. Otherwise it will simply be
  ignored. Nodetypes inheriting SoVertexShape will then get their
  coordinate data from the vertexProperty node instead of from the
  global traversal state.

  The vertexProperty field of SoVertexShape-derived nodes breaks
  somewhat with the basic design of Open Inventor, as its contents are
  not passed to the global state. This is done to provide a simple
  path to highly optimized rendering of vertexbased shapes.
