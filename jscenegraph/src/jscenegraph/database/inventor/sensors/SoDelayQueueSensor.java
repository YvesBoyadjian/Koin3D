 |      Abstract base class for all sensors that are added to the delay
 |      queue, which means that they will be executed at some time in the
 |      future (when there is idle time, or when a user-defined timeout
 |      occurs-- see SoDB::setDelaySensorTimeout()).
 |
 |      Sensors in the delay queue are sorted by priorities. A priority of
 |      0 indicates that the sensor is immediate and should be triggered
 |      immediately when it is scheduled. Sensors with other priorities
 |      are sorted by increasing priority.

\class SoDelayQueueSensor
\ingroup Sensors
Delay queue sensors are separate from timer queue sensors (see
SoTimerQueueSensor) and provide methods for setting the relative
priorities of the sensors in the delay queue (sensors with higher
priorities will be triggered first).


Sensors with non-zero priorities are added to the delay queue when
scheduled, and are all processed once, in order, when the delay queue
is processed, which normally happens as part of your program's main
loop.  Typically, the delay
queue is processed whenever there are no events waiting to be
distributed and there are no timer queue sensors waiting to be
triggered.  The delay queue also has a timeout to ensure that delay
queue sensors are triggered even if there are always events or timer
sensors waiting; see
SoDB::setDelaySensorTimeout().


Sensors with priority 0 are treated specially.  Priority 0 sensors are
triggered almost immediately after they are scheduled, before the
program returns to the main loop.  Priority 0 sensors are not
necessarily triggered immediately when they are scheduled, however; if
they are scheduled as part of the evaluation of a field connection
network they may not be triggered until the evaluation of the network
is complete.  Also, if a priority 0 sensor is scheduled within the
callback method of another priority 0 sensor, it will not be triggered
until the callback method is complete (also note that if more than one
priority 0 sensor is scheduled, the order in which they fire is
undefined).
