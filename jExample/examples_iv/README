This directory contains collections of 3D geometric models.
Many of the files include credits (see ivinfo, below).

By convention, Inventor format files are denoted by the .iv suffix.

Useful tools that operate on .iv files include:
  . ivcat
      Converts binary Inventor files to ASCII (e.g. ivcat cube.iv)
      Converts ASCII Inventor files to binary (e.g. ivcat -b ascii.iv > bin.iv)

  . ivinfo
      Lists a summary of an Inventor file contents, including the data credits
      (if there are any)

  . ivfix
      Reads an Inventor file and restructures the data to improve the scene's
      rendering performance.

  . ivview
      Simple viewer to view Inventor files.

  . /usr/demos/Inventor/SceneViewer
      More elaborate viewer to view and manipulate Inventor files.

  . ivdowngrade
      Converts an Inventor file to version 2.0 or 1.0
